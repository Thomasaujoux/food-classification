## I) Context

### 1) Data Preprocessing

In this file we will explore data preprocessing in order to improve the quality of the data and to make it suitable for "Exploratory Data Analysis" or "Multi-Label Classification", we will transform the raw data in a useful and efficient format. 

This includes different steps :

- Data Integration  

We will combine different sources to create an unified dataset.

- Data Cleaning 

Missing Data : Some data are missing in the dataset from Oqali, we will handle this in different ways (Ignore it or Fill the missing values).
Noisy Data : Some data liked ingredients are too specific thus meaninless for machine learning, we will ingore them too.

- Data Transformation  

The goal is to transform the data in appropriate forms for Machine Learning, this will involved different NLP steps like normalization, standardization, and discretization.

- Data Reduction :

This entails lowering the amount of the dataset while retaining critical information. Techniques such as feature selection and feature extraction can be used to reduce data. 

### 2)  NLP Steps

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a Data Science subfield that deals with text data. We are going to focus on one branch of NLP, text classification. To do this, we'll take a look at the various stages that are :
- Change Case
- Tokenization
- Stop-Words Removal
- Stemming
- N-grams
- Vectorization
