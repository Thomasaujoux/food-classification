## I) Context

In this file we will explore data preprocessing in order to improve the quality of the data and to make it suitable for "Exploratory Data Analysis" or "Multi-Label Classification", we will transform the raw data in a useful and efficient format. 

Data Cleaning :
- Missing Data : Some data are missing in the dataset from Oqali, we will handle this in different ways (Ignore it or Fill the missing values)
- Noisy Data : Some data liked ingredients are too specific thus meaninless for machine learning

Data Transformation : 
The goal is to transform the data in appropriate forms for Machine Learning, this will involved different NLP steps
